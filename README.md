# Jejomar Parrilla Portfolio

A modern, minimal, and professional developer portfolio built as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and clean architecture.

## 🚀 Overview
This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. It is designed for performance, accessibility, and easy content updates, using only semantic HTML, CSS (with variables and animations), and vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Features
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Fast, seamless navigation without page reloads
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML, ARIA roles/labels, keyboard navigation, and alt text
- **Modern UI/UX**: CSS variables, micro animations, and a clean, minimal aesthetic
- **Modular Structure**: Easy to add or update skills, projects, and services
- **Dynamic Content**: Projects, skills, and services are loaded from data arrays for easy maintenance
- **Slick Slider**: Project images use a slick, touch-friendly carousel

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic, accessible)
- **CSS3** (variables, BEM, Grid/Flexbox, transitions, keyframes)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** (modules, classes, async/await)
- **[jQuery & Slick Carousel](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)** (for project sliders)
